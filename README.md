## Print setting suggestions

There are a lot of steep overhangs in the lower layers due to the print orientation. If your slicer supports it, it's better to print outer walls first to prevent warping which might result in small details in lower layers getting knocked off.  ("External pemimeters first" for Slic3r and forks and "Wall Ordering -> Outside to Inside" for Cura)
